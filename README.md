<h1>Still Demo of the Pokedex.</h1>

<h3>Changelog:</h3>

<h5>v 0.05</h5>
<ul>
<li>I've chosen not to proceed with sessions and passport authorization, as I planned in the beginning, and decided to use the technology the big guys use, sooo..... JWT authorization is on the boardðŸŽ‰</li>
<li>Create new user, log in, get your authorization token, go to your personal page,  be able to make authorized request (actually, in this version there's only only one request like this - delete user)</li>
<li>P.S: It's still a test version, so functionality first. All the ugly stuff will be fixed after I implement few ideas I have. Click around)</li>
</ul>

<h5>v 0.04 </h5>
<ul>
<li>MUI dialogue reg/login form added.</li>
<li>Node.js + Express backend server added. Mongo database added. Now you can create user and kinda simulate login process by comparing user's input data and actual data in the db.
All the actual profits of it are on the way. This version basically is a matter of checkpoint.
